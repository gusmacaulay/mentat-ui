                  <a>%mentat is an interface to a selection of LLMs from replicate.com.
                    It currently supports queries, chat, image generation (%turf integration soon!), 
                    todo list management, and reminders (message notifications also coming soon).  
                  </a>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                  <a>You can find models to use, and get an api key at https://replicate.com/
                  </a>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                  <a>%mentat uses %gato to watch Groups Chats, Silo to store images, and outputs
                    all its todo lists to Notebooks.  While the image generation will work without
                    Silo, %gato is a dependency.

                  <div>
                  <a>From this UI you can manage your LLM chatbot, setting up different models to run for 
                    different requests.
                    You'll be making those requests in any Groups Chats that are yours, as %gato will be
                    watching and waiting for requests.  Making requests is simple, just call the bot and 
                    the model and tell it what you want, like so...

                  <h4 className="text-align-centre">Using %mentat</h4>
                  <a>%mentat comes with a number of helpful models pre-loaded for current demonstration purposes - 
                    so you can use it right out of the box.  To set it up for yourself, you can simply update the 
                    api-key with your replicate.com api-key and leave the models the way they are (probably best, there's
                    a lot going on under the hood).  Or if you want to play around with it, you can set up your preferred
                    replicate.com models to run for each centag (%img, %todo %query, %chat, %remind).
